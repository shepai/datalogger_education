## Setting up

You will need a Raspberry Pi Pico, a computer with USB connection and to download <a href="https://thonny.org/">Thonny IDE</a>. 

Once you have all of these, you may need to reflash the Raspberry Pi Pico if it is new. To do this hold down the bbotsel button and then connect the usb to the pico and computeer. Be sure to keep the button pressed in this time. Once it is connected it should come up with the boot menu. Drag the most <a href="https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/">recent download of circuitpython</a> for Pico into the folder. 

See <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython/circuitpython">this tutorial</a> for more detail.

## Wiring
To wire up your data logger you will need to select sensors you want to read from, SD card reader, breadboard, buttons and Pico. 

First begin by placing each component you will be using on the breadboard so that the lines do not cross, we will use jumper wires to connect the electronics.
