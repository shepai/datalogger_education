# datalogger_education
This repo is for the taster workshops on building data logging devices for dataset collection. This repo contains equipment list, instructions, example code and machine learning labsheets. 

## Building the device
You can see instructions and code for building the device under /DataLoggers. Tis will show you how to construct a Raspberry Pi Pico datalogger (optional sd card). Once this is done and your dataset collected, you can move on to machine learning. 

## Machine Learning classification
Now we have a dataset we can build classifiers to recognise whether a movement is one or another. Head over to /MachineLearning to convert your datasets into the formats required and train a model to classisfy. 

You will need either google notebooks or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">vscode</a> with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1sAzPojKMg">jupyter extention </a>.
